## Problems

* Out of order events delivery - state depends on events delivery order
* Duplicate events delivery - state gets currupted by duplicates
* Network partitioning - ?
* Remote, slow updates - updates affected by unavailability and remoteness of central storage
* Original events not persisted, only state
